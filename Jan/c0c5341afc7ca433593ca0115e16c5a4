 trustieee 123RF.com&#x201c;This partnership, with the focus on work integrated learning, not only highlights the standard of the university&#x2019;s teaching and learning programmes but also reflects the faculty&#x2019;s drive to ensure that graduates are equipped to teach in diverse environments,&#x201d; says Prof Sarah Gravett, executive dean of the Faculty of Education, UJ. Speaking ahead of the signing, Mathew Neal, superintendent of schools, American Creativity Academy, &#x201c;The partnerships between a university, such as UJ, and K12 schools, such as the American Creativity Academy is essential in preparing future leaders for excellence in education.&#x201d; Prof Gravett pointed out that having a global teaching experience and understanding of other cultures is part of the faculty&#x2019;s undertaking to graduate teachers with wide-ranging experience in a number of different settings. &#x201c;Excellence in teacher preparation is the hallmark of what we see to be the greatest advantage of teachers. Educators benefit tremendously when prestigious teacher programmes, like UJ&#x2019;s offerings, incorporate global learning,&#x201d; said Neal. Signing the Memorandum of Understanding: Mr Dahi al-Fadhli, CEO of American Creativity Academy and Prof Sarah Gravett, the Executive Dean of the Faculty of Education, UJ.Memoona Mahomed, lecturer and mentor to the students added, &#x201c;The students should be proud of themselves, as this is the first time South African students have participated in this venture. Our students&#x2019; performance was exceptional, as they taught within a global curriculum. Students displayed caring and nurturing disposition throughout their engagement with the learners. They taught lessons within a global curriculum context and this meant much research had to be undertaken by the students in preparation of their lessons.&#x201d; &#x201c;I am grateful to have been able to be involved in the teaching experience programme. It would not have been possible if it were not for the lecturing staff at UJ and all the support I received from the university throughout my studies. I am proud to be associated with an institution that continues to give students opportunities to gain experience in the field,&#x201d; says UJ&#x2019;s Sadia Dangor, a 4th year BEd Senior Phase and Further Education and Training student.
